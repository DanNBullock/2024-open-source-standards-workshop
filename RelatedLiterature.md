    - Type: Report
    - Author:  Blind, Knut;  Thumm, Nikolaus;  Böhm, Mirko
    - Year: 2019
    - Identifier: 978-92-76-11593-9; [10.2760/163594](https://dx.doi.org/10.2760/163594)

    - Abstract / Summary: In this 2019 European Commission, [Joint Research Centre (JRC)](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/joint-research-centre_en) report, the interactions and relationships between the socio-technical processes of Open Source Software (OSS) development communities and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is analyzed.  Of particular interest to the report are issues of incentive structures/systems, Intellectual Property Rights/regimes (IPR), and collaboration (within SDOs/OSS communities and between SDOs and OSS communities).  The report includes a consideration of 20 case studies and the provision of recommendations to a broad range of stakeholders, in fulfillment of [the inciting charge](https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/26583) issued by the European Commission on this subject.
      \nOf particular salience and interest to the current workshop endeavor is the overarching conceptual framework provided by the analysis, which can be understood to subsume the (sub)-domain of Open Source Ecosystems for data and metadata standard development and promulgation.

    - Abstract / Summary: "This report is part of designing the digital preservation ensemble. It focuses on research data file formats, whose understandability, prevalence and software support are important for data reuse. The report is based on international sources and interviews with Finnish researchers. Additionally, the report presents preliminary requirements for accepting research datasets for digital preservation."[[source](https://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/147761)]

    - Title: **Request for Information (RFI): Proposed Use of Common Data Elements (CDEs) for NIH-Funded Clinical Research and Trials**
    - Organization: [NIH ODSS](https://datascience.nih.gov/about/odss)
    - Link: [https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-063.html](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-063.html)
    - Abstract / Summary: "The purpose of the Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit public input on 1) a set of minimum core common data elements (CDEs) that would be used across all NIH funded/conducted clinical studies/trials and community-based research involving human participants; 2) additional CDEs for social determinants of health (SDoH) and clinical domains including autoimmune diseases and immune-mediated diseases; and 3) technologies, tools and policies that could facilitate the use of NIH CDEs.  NIH CDEs are defined as CDEs “recommended” or “required” by an NIH body, and/or found in the NIH CDE Repository. These RFI responses will be used to inform NIH’s continuing guidance on CDE use and assist in the planning for adequate resources for CDE implementation."
